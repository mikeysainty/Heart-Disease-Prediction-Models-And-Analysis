# Heart Disease Prediction Models and Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for predicting the likelihood of heart disease using various machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 dataset. It includes various health-related attributes and is publicly available on Kaggle. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and model interpretation.

## Summary
The results of the models show the following key points:
- **High Accuracy:** Logistic Regression and Neural Network models show the highest accuracy, indicating they are generally good at predicting the overall outcome.
- **Precision and Recall for Class 0 (No Heart Disease):** All models have high precision and recall for class 0, indicating they are very good at correctly identifying individuals without heart disease.
- **Struggling with Class 1 (Heart Disease):** Most models have lower precision and recall for class 1, indicating they struggle to correctly identify individuals with heart disease.
  - Logistic Regression and Random Forest models have moderate precision but very low recall for class 1.
  - Neural Network has higher precision for class 1 but still has very low recall.
  - Naive Bayes shows a more balanced approach with relatively higher recall for class 1 but lower precision.
- **Class Imbalance:** The significant class imbalance in the dataset (229,787 instances of no heart disease vs. 23,893 instances of heart disease) affects the models' ability to correctly identify heart disease cases compared to no heart disease cases.
- **F1-Scores:** F1-scores are generally higher for class 0 across all models, showing that they perform better at predicting no heart disease.

## Conclusion
The models are very good at correctly predicting the absence of heart disease (class 0) but struggle more with predicting the presence of heart disease (class 1). This indicates a need for further tuning and possibly exploring additional features or different modeling approaches to improve recall for heart disease cases.
